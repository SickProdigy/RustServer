Here are the commands:

Go to PuTTy

login, go to the right folder, i used lgsm to install rust so this is how it updates also.

https://linuxgsm.com/lgsm/rustserver/

./rustserver      // List Full commands

./rustserver check-update   // check local and remote build

./rustserver stop
./rustserver update   // This will update rust, may wipe the server not sure
./rustserver validate     // validate files
./rustserver mods-update      // I reckon will just update the Oxide, not sure about plugins. shouldn't update plugins no.

./rustserver start

./rustserver restart
./rustserver details
./rustserver debug
./rustserver backup
./rustserver monitor    // idk wtf 
./rustserver console    // watch rustserver boot but doesnt really watch it, did at first. // it now works, shows server boot. I changed some lines to log it locally so that kind of fucked it up.
ctrl+b the press "d" to exit console.   (ctrl+c will fuck it up and you must stop and start server again)
/home/ruster/rustserver/serverfiles/rustserver.txt    // Boot Log location, if server isn't booting check here for logs.
