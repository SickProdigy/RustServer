Here are the commands:

Go to PuTTy

login, go to the right folder, i used lgsm to install rust so this is how it updates also.

./rustserver stop
./rustserver update   // This will update rust, may wipe the server not sure
./rustserver mods-update      // I reckon will just update the Oxide, not sure about plugins. shouldn't update plugins no.
./rustserver start
